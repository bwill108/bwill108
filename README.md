## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Brian, a  professional data analyst
<p allign= 'left'> Hi, i'm Brian, a professional data analyst specializing in logistics/supply chain, but eager to leverage my big data and visualization skills in other fields as well.
After 9 years in the logistics industry, I found the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics program, a comprehensive 4-month bootcamp. Throughout the course, I gained hands-on experience with Python, SQL, data visualization, and Power BI, enhancing my skills in data analysis. With these new capabilities, I am now ready to leverage my expertise to contribute to business growth and drive impactful insights.

Some facts about me:
- I enjoy live music concerts (although my music taste does not align with that of my wifes)
- I love running and working out in the gym.
- I'm a new dad to a beautiful little girl.
